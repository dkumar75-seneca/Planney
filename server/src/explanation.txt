accountValidator.js: Handles all of the user identity validation procedures (including getting user access level).

accountManagement.js: Handles all of user account management procedures (like signup and login).

requestValidator.js: Handles all of the user input data validation procedures.

requestManagement.js: Formats the user request into a database connector compatible query.
